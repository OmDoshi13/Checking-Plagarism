Supply chain management is a crucial aspect of any business. It involves the planning, sourcing, production, and distribution of goods to ensure efficiency. Companies aim to optimize their supply chain by implementing technology-driven solutions. 

One of the key factors in supply chain optimization is data analytics. By analyzing past trends and current market conditions, businesses can make informed decisions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also playing a significant role in improving forecasting accuracy.

Sustainability is another growing concern in supply chains. Companies are now focusing on reducing their carbon footprint and implementing green logistics strategies.
